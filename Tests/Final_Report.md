### ðŸ“‚ Defect Log Summary

Defect ID: D-001
Title: Inconsistent App URL Handling

Description:
Opening the application using VS Code Live Server (http://127.0.0.1:5500) results in data loss â€” scheduled pickups do not reflect in the dashboard. However, launching via React script (http://localhost:3000) performs as expected.
