### Defect ID: D-001

**Title:** Inconsistent App URL Handling

**Description:**
When the CleanCity application is opened using the VS Code Live Server (`http://127.0.0.1:5500`), user actions such as scheduling a waste pickup do not reflect on the dashboard. However, when the app is launched via `npm start` using React scripts (`http://localhost:3000`), all features and data interactions behave as expected.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Start the application using `npm start`.
2. Observe that the app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Instead, open the app via VS Code Live Server which launches at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
4. Attempt to register, schedule a pickup, or perform any data-driven task.
5. Login to dashboard and observe that scheduled pickups are missing.

**Expected Result:**

* All user actions (e.g., scheduling pickups) should reflect in the dashboard regardless of which local server is used.

**Actual Result:**

* Data does not persist or reflect properly when the app is opened via Live Server.

**Evidence (Screenshots):**

* üì∏ **Screenshot 1:** App running at `http://localhost:3000` with full feature access and correct behavior.

* üì∏ **Screenshot 2:** App running at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` with form displayed, but backend functionality (e.g., scheduling pickup) not reflected.
